\chapter{Design principles}
\label{chap:design}


\xxx{This chapter describes the main design principle of the data-driven low-code programming system for creating web applications shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:walktrough}. }

\section{Data-driven approach}

\xxx{
	The main general design principle of the proposed programming system is the \emph{data-driven} approach to creating applications.
	By data-driven, we mean that the creation of a particular application starts by providing \emph{concrete data} to the system.
	The development process is then tied to the specific data provided.
	This approach is similar to existing systems such as the previously presented~Darklang~\ref{sec:darklang} or \citet{mendix}.
}

\xxx{
	The system analyzes the provided data and provides development options based on its structure and properties.
	The analysis can be tailored to the specific aims of the programming system.
	For example, the proposed application for creating web applications can analyze the data and map it to specific HTML elements based on its type and structure.
	Usually, the developer performs this data analysis and creates the GUI elements by hand.
	Using this approach, the developer can offload some of this work onto the system and focus on other aspects of the development process.
}

\xxx{
	The data analysis can employ various techniques, such as data structure and type recognition.
	It can be performed once after the data is provided to the system, and the system provides options based on this single analysis.
	Alternatively, the system can perform it continuously throughout the development process and provide development options based on the already created application elements, similar to Output-directed programming \ref{sec:odp}.
	It may also be enhanced through the use of various machine-learning techniques.
}

\xxx{
	Another valuable property of systems employing this approach is the ability to use them in conjunction with other existing technologies, mainly those focused on data manipulation and retrieval.
	For example, the proposed system employing this approach can be used in conjunction with existing technologies such as \citet{graphql}.
	Using GraphQL, the developer can specify the data they wish to use and its structure.
	This data can then be provided to the system and used to create the desired web application.
}

\xxx{
	Our prototype programming system is what \citet{Sahay_Indamutsa_Di} call a \emph{Data to UI} programming system.
	The main difference between our programming system and other \emph{Data to UI} systems such as \citet{mendix} is that the creation of the user interface is directly tied to the data provided to the application.
	Usually, the \emph{Data to UI} systems provide options to create pre-made UI components, which may then reference and use the provided data.
	This is fundamentally different from our described data-driven approach.
}

\section{Low-code editor}

\xxx{
	The second design principle is the concept of a \emph{low-code editor}.
	Low-code editors usually provide a graphical user interface through which the developer interacts with the system and develops the desired application.
	The system provides contextual menus to aid in the creation of the application.
	Various existing low-code programming editors were presented previously in section \ref{sec:low-code}.
}

\xxx{
	The visual design and functionality of the system is inspired by the "what you see is what you get" (abbreviated as \emph{WYSIWYG}) editors\cite{Yang_Gupta_Botev_Churchill_Levchenko_Shanmugasundaram_2008}.
	This sub-category of low-code editors displays the application's output as if it were running inside its native environment.
	This allows the system to update the output every time a change is made to the program and display its result, allowing for a more dynamic development loop \cite{output-directed-programming}.
}

\xxx{
	Our prototype system interweaves the contextual menus with the application's output, as seen in chapter \ref{chap:walktrough}.
	Each menu is placed next to the corresponding element, which it can modify.
	The developer can also hide these menus and show only the application's output.
}

\section{Code generation}

\xxx{
	The last main design principle is the ability to generate a code representation of the created application.
	This addresses some of the concerns and main pitfalls of many low-code programming systems, as stated by \citet{Pinho_Aguiar_Amaral_2023}.
	These concerns include \emph{Interoperability issues} and \emph{Vendor lock-in},
	both are mitigated as the user can download the already created part of the application in its textual representation and continue its modification in another programming system.
}

\xxx{
	Our prototype implementation also provides code a generation capability.
	The type system of the application has represents the created parts of the application in a form which allows translation of the application into various programming languages and other technologies.
	It can target the PHP programming language but could be easily extended to provide a wider selection of target technologies.
