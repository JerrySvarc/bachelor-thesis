\section{Low-code development systems}
\xxx{Low-code development has been defined by \citet{Pinho_Aguiar_Amaral_2023} as \emph{"an approach for software development that uses tools that minimize (or eliminate) the number of lines of code written."}
This definition accommodates a broad spectrum of tools and development practices, such as visual programming tools, integrated development environments with code generation capabilities,
artificial intelligence development tools, and generators generating source code based on template files. 
In this thesis, we will mainly focus on visual programming tools enabling the creation and modification of programs using a graphical user interface. }

\xxx{Visual programming tools present a graphical user interface to the user. This graphical user interface serves as an abstraction over 
the development domain and provides tools to create and modify software through this user interface.}
