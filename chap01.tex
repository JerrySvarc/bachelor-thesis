\section{Low-code development systems}
\xxx{Low-code development has been defined by \citet{Pinho_Aguiar_Amaral_2023} as \emph{"an approach for software development that uses tools that minimize (or eliminate) the number of lines of code written."}
This definition can accommodate a broad spectrum of different tools and development practices, such as visual programming tools, static site generators,  
These tools can be of various forms, but we will focus mainly on visual programming tools. }

\xxx{Visual programming tools present a graphical user interface to the user. This graphical user interface serves as an abstraction over 
the development domain and provides tools to create and modify software through this user interface.}
