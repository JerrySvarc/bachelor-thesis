\section{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Takes inspiration from low-code editors and output-directed programming. The output is displayed alongside the modification low-code menus.
    \item Changes are visible as soon as user makes them
    \item Useful with GraphQL -> get data using GraphQL -> put it in the editor and create the application interface -> modify behavior -> generate code
    \item Ability to generate code to integrate into an existing codebase -> system should allow generating code in different languages/frameworks
    \item Some elements make sense for specific data, but not all
    \item Inferring elements based on the datatypes provided
