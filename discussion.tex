\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

In previous Chapters, we explored the design concepts and implementation of our proposed Data-driven UI programming system.
We also tested the prototype implementation on various simple tasks, such as a simple \emph{To-do application}.

In this Chapter, we will critically evaluate our work and describe its benefits and limitations, as well as potential avenues of future research.
