Every approach to software development has associated benefits and limitations.
For example, \citet{Pinho_Aguiar_Amaral_2023} identified several benefits and pitfalls associated with existing Low-code programming systems.
Some of the common benefits and limitations of existing Low-code programming systems are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Common Benefits:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \emph{Low requirements for technical skills}
		      \item \emph{High speed/short development time}
		      \item \emph{Allows for learning concepts}
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Common Pitfalls:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \emph{Interoperability issues}
		      \item \emph{Vendor lock-in}
		      \item \emph{Writing more code than intended}
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


In this chapter, we will critically evaluate our work and describe its benefits, limitations, and potential avenues for future research.
We will separate the limitations of the Data-driven Low-code approach from the limitations of our Data-driven UI programming system prototype as to
better evaluate the potential feasibility of the approach itself.

\section{Benefits of the approach}

In our work, we identify several benefits of the Data-driven Low-code approach in the context of creating client-side web applications.
Each benefit is a direct result of our specific design principles as described in Chapter~\ref{chap:design}.
The benefits are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Guided UI element creation:}
	\item \textbf{Mitigates Vendor lock-in:}
	\item \textbf{Mitigates Interoperability issues:}
\end{itemize}


\section{Limitations of the approach}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Necessity to prepare data in advance:}
	\item \textbf{Potentially resource intensive:}
	\item \textbf{Low-code interface design:}
\end{itemize}
