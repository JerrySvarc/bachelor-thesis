\chapter{Core logic}
\label{chap:corelogic}

This chapter describes the core logic of the programming system.
Firstly, we describe the hole-based approach applied to the creation of elements.
After that, we describe the type system, mainly the internal representation of the UI elements and necessary operations on these types.
Then, we describe mapping of the different input data types to specific types representing the UI elements.
We present two ways of combining the created UI elements with the corresponding data.
Lastly, we describe one possible way of displaying a preview of the created UI elements and the modification menus.

\section{Hole-based approach}
The holeâˆ’based approach is

\subsection{RenderingCode}
The \emph{RenderingCode} is a discriminated union type used to represent the UI elements.
Each case represents a type of an HTML element.
