This thesis presents a novel data-driven approach for creating the client-side part of dynamic single-page applications. 
We aim to create a low-code programming system based on a data-driven approach. 
The data-driven approach involves first providing data to the application, which serves as the model of the application.
Then, the programming system aids the developer in creating the user interface by providing suggestions based on the structure and type of the data.
After creating the user interface, the developer can add semantic meaning to the data by modifying the behavior of these components and how they change the data itself. 
This system will allow the developers to create the client-side portion of the application without the need to write a large amount of boilerplate code. }

\xxx{In Chapter \ref{chap:approach}, we will explore the functionality and usefulness of the programming system by 
creating example web applications from the \citet{7GUIs-web}. }

\xxx{In Chapter \ref{chap:implementation}, we will analyze the implementation of the low-code programming system
for creating single-page applications based on concrete data. We will explore the structure of the system and how exactly
it works.   }

\xxx{In Chapter \ref{chap:eval}, we will explore the functionality and usefulness of the programming system by 
creating example web applications from the \citet{7GUIs-web}. }
