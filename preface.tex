\xxx {Web development has been rapidly evolving since the early days of the Internet. The applications being developed went from static sites being built using only HTML and CSS to 
dynamic single-page web applications or full client desktop applications running in the browser using WebAssembly. 
The development of single-page dynamic web applications can be done using many different technologies. 
Developers can employ various frameworks and libraries to create the client-side portion of the application, making the development process more ergonomic, easier to understand, and easier to learn.
The usual approach to creating particularly single-page dynamic applications is to create the user interface first and then
add the necessary data. }

\xxx{
This thesis will present a novel data-driven approach to creating dynamic single-page applications. 
We will create a low-code programming system based on a design principle that the website construction starts from concrete data. 
This approach has been inspired by the approach of the Sketch-n-Sketch IDE \cite{Hempel_Lubin_Chugh_2019}.
Meaning that the developer first provides data to the application. This data then serves as the model of the application.
Then, the programming system aids the developer in creating the user interface by providing suggestions. This user interface is based on the structure and type of the data 
which the developer can add semantic meaning to. 
After creating the user interface, the developer can add semantic meaning to the data by modifying the behavior of these components and how they change the data itself.
