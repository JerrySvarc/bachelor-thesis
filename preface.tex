\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Since the advent of the \emph{World Wide Web}, developers have been creating web applications mainly by writing and modifying text-based code.
Today, this process is made more accessible by using different tools, libraries, frameworks, and programming systems.
For example, tools such as the \citet{react} library or the \citet{vuejs} framework make it possible to compose web applications from reusable components but still require the user to write and modify text-based code.

Some programming systems allow an alternative approach of \emph{low-code} software development.
\citet{Pinho_Aguiar_Amaral_2023} define \emph{low-code programming systems} as ``systems that aim to significantly reduce the amount of code needed to create specific applications.''
These systems employ an alternative way of creating and modifying the software components by providing a \emph{Graphical User interface (GUI)} and modification tools that aid the user during the creation process.
The popularity of these systems has been increasing in recent years, as stated by \citet{Sahay_Indamutsa_Di}.

\citet{Sahay_Indamutsa_Di} identify that low-code systems provide two main approaches to creating the \emph{User Interface (UI)} of software applications, and they are \textbf{UI to Data} and \textbf{Data to UI}.
\emph{UI to Data} involves creating the application's UI and populating it with data, whereas \emph{Data to UI} is a data-driven approach where the UI is created \emph{after} modeling necessary data.
The \emph{AppForge} programming system presented by~\citet{Yang_Gupta_Botev_Churchill_Levchenko_Shanmugasundaram_2008} provides tools to create user interface elements of web applications and automatically creates corresponding database schema and application logic.
The system also provides tools to create UI elements based on existing database schemas and custom logic.

Systems such as~\citet{mendix}~or~\citet{darklang} specialize in providing a comprehensive low-code development platform for creating specific components of web applications.
Other programming systems, such as \emph{Sketch-n-Sketch} presented by~\citet{sketch-and-sketch}, combine the low-code approach
with other programming techniques, such as \emph{output-directed programming}~\cite{output-directed-programming}, to enhance the system's functionality and development process.

This thesis will focus mainly on the \emph{data to UI} low-code approach.
We aim to explore the \emph{data to UI} approach in the context of creating \emph{client-side web applications}, providing an alternative to traditional text-based development methods.
We will design and implement a \emph{prototype} low-code programming system named \textbf{InterfaceSmith} inspired mainly by the functionality of the \emph{AppForge} programming system.
The \emph{data to UI} process will be influenced by the \emph{type} of data provided to the system and also its \emph{structure}.
The application's UI elements will then be created through a sequence of steps, mirroring the structure of the provided data.
The programming system will then aid the developer in modifying the user interface by providing relevant context menus.
After creating and modifying the UI elements, the system will provide behavior modification options inspired by~\citet{elm} and the~\citet{elm-arch}.
After the developer finishes the implementation process, they can preview the created application and download its text-based representation.

Based on the definition of low-code programming systems, we will evaluate the results based on the number of lines of code (LOC) that the user needs to write to implement the selected tasks and whether the functionality of the desired task has been successfully implemented.

\section*{InterfaceSmith}
\nopagebreak[4]
The main output of this thesis is the InterfaceSmith application shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prototype-teaser}.
The user interface consists of a movable canvas containing various draggable canvas elements.
The main element is the UI modification and preview element, which previews the application's created parts alongside modification menus. It is also resizable, simulating a browser window.
Other elements include a view of the uploaded data, elements for creating and modifying the behavior of the UI elements, and elements for creating custom JavaScript functions.
The resulting code is generated based on the created elements. The system creates an application in pure JavaScript using the Elm architecture\cite{elm-arch}, but it could be extended to target other technologies.
We will describe the system's design, implementation, and functionality in the following chapters.
